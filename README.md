The projects I did for fun on C language

Projects based on the [Youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBOPkQsFLCR2DWRY74L03FmbRtz_Yy73_ "YouTube course")

- [Hungry Dog](https://github.com/shvetsovart/my_C_projects/blob/main/hungry_dog.c "Hungry Dog")

It is just a "@" symbol (Dog) surrounded by walls reaching for some "\*" symbols (apples) and updating "Eaten apples" counter
